The Monginis packaging design project was executed within a clearly defined client framework. Our challenge was to craft distinctive concepts for a customer base already familiar with the core product line, while consistently introducing fresh variants and seasonal offerings throughout the year. From elegant chocolate box packaging to vibrant designs for the seasonal and festive cake range, each design was tailored to resonate with evolving consumer expectations while preserving brand familiarity.
