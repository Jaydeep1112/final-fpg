As a design firm, we were introduced to the Africab Group for designing work for their new logistics business in Eastern Africa, which we successfully delivered to the group's satisfaction. Impressed by our work, the management entrusted us with the redesign of the company’s logo and branding, alongside a comprehensive revamp of its subsidiary companies, brands, and overall visual communication. Since then, we have maintained a strong partnership with the forward-thinking Africab Group—shaping impactful brands rooted in strategic insight and elevated through creativity and technology. Our contributions have spanned across creative advertising, website design, brochures, catalogues, and brand consultancy. Beyond design, our role extended to brand consultancy and end-to-end production support, delivering high-quality printed brochures and marketing catalogues that aligned with their growth vision.
