Our long-standing partnership with the forward-thinking Royal Group began with comprehensive branding and design consulting. This evolved into a major initiative to revamp the Royal Group and Kings Brand logos, setting the tone for a full-scale overhaul of their visual communication. We developed a suite of deliverables—including individual project brochures, company profile videos, and websites—crafted to reflect the group's renewed identity. Beyond design, our role extended to brand consultancy and end-to-end production support, delivering high-quality printed brochures and marketing catalogues that aligned with their growth vision.
