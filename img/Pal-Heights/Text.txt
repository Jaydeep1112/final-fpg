Our creative partnership with the Pal Heights Group of Hotels and Resorts began in 2008 with the design of their first logo and brand identity. A decade later, when the group expanded with a new venture—a hotel integrated with a mall and a collection of restaurants—we were once again entrusted with the complete branding suite. This included logo creation, menu designs, marketing brochures, and a fully responsive website, ensuring a cohesive and sophisticated brand presence across all touchpoints.
