What began as a single project brochure for HK Properties—a leading real estate developer in East Africa—evolved into a comprehensive branding journey. We went on to design the brand logo, develop all project brochures, and build a dynamic website. The branding extended seamlessly into social media marketing, promotional video production, and a professionally crafted company profile brochure—ensuring a consistent and compelling brand presence across platforms.
