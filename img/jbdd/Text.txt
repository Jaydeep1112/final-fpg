Developed a distinct identity for JafferBhai Delhi Darbar's Catering division (JBDD Catering), which operated independently from the flagship restaurant business. The creative challenge lay in leveraging the existing logo and brand equity while distinguishing the catering arm through its own visual language. A refined Yellow & Grey theme, combined with the iconic JafferBhai motif, was introduced and seamlessly applied across marketing collateral and packagingâ€”ensuring brand continuity with a fresh, differentiated appeal
